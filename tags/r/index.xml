      <title>Add Keyboard Shortcut R&#39;s Pipe Operator (%&gt;%) to Jupyter Lab</title>

      <description>Recently, I have started using JupyterLab to write data science blog posts in both R &amp;amp; Python languages. I have found out that the keyboard shortcut in R Studio for pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%) Ctrl + Shift + M is not working in JupyterLab. Since I am used to %&amp;gt;% shortcut in RStudio, why not I add that into Jupyter Lab?
To do this, we would need to edit the settings for JupyterLab&amp;rsquo;s keyboard shortcut plugin.</description>

      <description>When I was studying in the university, I learnt R programming to complete my final year project, Text Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling. It was a nightmare for me as the tasks were not as easy as I thought, especially for someone without strong foundation in data science programming languages (e.g. R, Python).
For a complete beginner, there are plenty of resources you could easily find to pick up a new programming language.</description>
