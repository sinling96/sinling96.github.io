      <description>As a developer, we should always follow the rule:
 If you start doing some action with the mouse, stop and think if there is a shortcut. If there is one - use it.
 In this document, I will list down several shortcut that I find useful in navigating Jupyter Notebook.
Note: These shortcut can be applied to both Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab, except for the customized shortcut, which is only available in Jupyter Lab as far as I understand.</description>

      <description>Despite the rapid development of AI technology, there are still a huge amount of text data remained undiscovered. Unstructured data contains a lot of data that would be useful if we know how to transform unstructured data to structured data.
In today&amp;rsquo;s tutorial, we are going to explore how we can classified text data to specific categories which could be useful for the analysis, by using Python package spaCy.
What is spaCy?</description>

      <description>Recently, I have started using JupyterLab to write data science blog posts in both R &amp;amp; Python languages. I have found out that the keyboard shortcut in R Studio for pipe operator (%&amp;gt;%) Ctrl + Shift + M is not working in JupyterLab. Since I am used to %&amp;gt;% shortcut in RStudio, why not I add that into Jupyter Lab?
To do this, we would need to edit the settings for JupyterLab&amp;rsquo;s keyboard shortcut plugin.</description>

      <title>How I Learn R</title>

      <description>When I was studying in the university, I learnt R programming to complete my final year project, Text Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling. It was a nightmare for me as the tasks were not as easy as I thought, especially for someone without strong foundation in data science programming languages (e.g. R, Python).
For a complete beginner, there are plenty of resources you could easily find to pick up a new programming language.</description>
