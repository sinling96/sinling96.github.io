      <description>I am a data analyst at Teleport. Being a multipotentialiate, I have interests in quite diverse of things:-
 🌱 Gardening 👩‍🍳 Cooking 📝 Blogging  I started this blog to document and share my learning journey in data field with you all. Having said that, I try not to limit my knowledge sharing to only data-related stuff.
So&amp;hellip; in future, my blog would cover almost any content that I personally think would be useful to you, either is related to data or gardening or something random or even a small story of mine :) Stay tune!</description>
