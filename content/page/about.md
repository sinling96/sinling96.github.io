I am a data analyst at [Teleport](https://www.teleport.asia/). Being a multipotentialiate, I have interests in quite diverse of things:- 
* 🌱Gardening
* 👩‍🍳Cooking
* 📝Blogging
* 📷 Vlogging - Feel free to follow me @ my youtube channel [*ShareSLife*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjXXsFlpilhHVWuCxmAnJMA)
* Data (Of Course!)

I started this blog to document and share my learning journey in data field with you all. Having said that, I try not to limit my knowledge sharing to only data-related stuff. 

So... in future, my blog would cover almost any content that I personally think would be useful to you, either is related to data or gardening or something random or even a small story of mine :) 
Stay tune!
